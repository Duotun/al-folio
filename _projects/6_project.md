The main contributions of this work are to utilize the mass-spring-damping system to obtain vibrations on collision events and provide an interface for sound simulation in Unity.

The innovative parts of this project mainly focus on the accelerating techniques for the real-time sound that could also be used for large scenes with even hundreds of objects producing sounds.
